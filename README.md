Creative portion: allow users to see number of likes on each story  

Grading comments: 
-1 logout works but I can navigate back to main through the url  
-8 stories don't appear once I've created them so I cannot edit or delete my stories, nor can I see stories that other users posted  
-2 no foreign keys in any tables and comments aren't associated with a story  
-3 stories can be posted (they might be in the database but they aren't on the UI so I can't really tell)  
-3 link doesn't have a database field (did you update your tables and forget to resubmit to github? there's a link box on the page but not a field in your tables)  
-4 can't post comments  
-3 stories cannot be edited or deleted  
-3 comments cannot be edited and deleted  
-3 doesn't follow fieo  
-2 doesn't pass validation  
-5 no csrf tokens  
-1 not visually appealing  
-15 creative: since I couldn't view the stories I can't view likes :/
